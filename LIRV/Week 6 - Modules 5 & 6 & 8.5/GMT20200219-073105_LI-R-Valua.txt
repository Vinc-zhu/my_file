00:21:21	student:	all good
00:25:05	A:	I’m currently working in HK as well, mics not working sorry
00:25:12	student:	sorry, my mic wasn't on mute
00:38:05	dbl:	go down by 10
00:38:08	iris:	Asset -10
00:38:08	student:	decrease by 10
00:38:24	dbl:	capital go down
00:38:50	dbl:	ah yep
00:38:58	dbl:	liabilities would reduce
00:39:20	dbl:	EPV(outgo) - EPV(premium)
00:39:37	dbl:	EPV(Outgo) goes down by 20
00:39:43	dbl:	EPV(premium) goes down by 10
00:39:45	student:	why?
00:41:20	dbl:	we need to hold 25 in assets to match future obligations
00:41:31	iris:	it’s loss making
00:41:33	Cameron:	-25 is the PV of future profits
00:41:34	dbl:	its loss making
00:41:34	S:	loss making?
00:42:53	student:	too conservative
00:42:54	Cameron:	we add a profit margin to the policy liability
00:42:59	I give up:	participating business?
00:42:59	S:	its more conservative than pricing assump
00:44:26	dbl:	profitable contract
00:44:39	dbl:	epv of future profit
00:46:15	Amy:	spread it
00:46:15	S:	earn it across the life of the policy
00:54:34	Harrison:	looks good
00:57:38	student:	how checks look?
00:58:11	student:	comments? 
01:00:28	chung-yi:	Say in the assignment, you perform some checks but it does not check up correctly or as expected, will you lose mark on it?
01:00:36	dbl:	Expected claims remains relatively level each year while expected premiums reduce each year with reducing in-force business volumes
01:01:54	chung-yi:	cool, thanks
01:05:47	dbl:	income - outgo - change in liab
01:08:06	dbl:	all equal to 0
01:09:17	dbl:	the higher discount rate reduces the pv of future profit
01:09:26	dbl:	and the initial loss is relatively larger
01:14:32	Amy:	delay profit
01:14:56	I give up:	will irr get impacted?
01:15:25	Amy:	why irr is here
01:15:48	I give up:	its a profitability metrics
01:16:00	dbl:	shouldn't
01:16:04	dbl:	because profit is the same
01:16:43	I give up:	thx
01:19:40	Amy:	why negative reserve at start considered reasonable?
01:20:31	Amy:	all good
01:21:13	dbl:	its similar to mos
01:22:53	Amy:	is smooth profit not a desirable feature?
01:27:06	dbl:	active and disabled lives
01:27:16	student:	on claim and inforce
01:30:07	student:	use decrements 
01:30:08	kat:	use expected termination rates
01:32:02	dbl:	assumes that policies end after the claim
01:35:43	student:	no
01:36:36	Harrison:	on what basis do they create their case estimate?
01:37:06	Amy:	not easy for long benefit period
01:37:12	Harrison:	so less data driven?
01:37:25	kat:	how do u use the estimate from case estimate ?
01:37:47	kat:	isn’t that accounted for in annuity factor ?
01:38:26	kat:	oh ok thank you
01:38:41	kat:	got it
01:38:41	Harrison:	sorry so for example if I have live A, then I take that to the assessor and they say they know of a person B and so we expect A to follow similar cashflow experience as B?
01:39:26	Harrison:	ok thanks
01:40:04	Harrison:	sorry 1 more question
01:40:09	LL:	sorry can you please explain again that conservative basis delays benefits? because looking at the numbers it doesn’t seem to be the case..? or did I misunderstand anything here..?
01:40:16	Harrison:	if you are signing off on the liability
01:40:25	dbl:	conservative basis delays profits
01:40:27	dbl:	not benefits
01:40:45	LL:	yeah I mean profits sorry
01:41:03	Harrison:	is that reasonable to justify your liability on what the case estimator said? what happens if that case estimator is not a good at his/her job?
01:42:28	dbl:	could depend on how your portfolio's claims experience compared to the industry
01:43:21	Harrison:	fair enough
01:43:30	LL:	basis 2 is more conservative than basis 1, but the profits seem to be released earlier than basis 1?
01:44:39	student:	the whole video will be recorded, right? 
01:44:46	student:	it won't stop at 8?
01:44:56	student:	cool
01:45:01	LL:	oh right so it’s not purely based on time 0 liability
01:45:05	dbl:	could be due to the choice in assumption change
01:45:05	LL:	I think I get it thanks
01:45:32	LL:	yeah make sense, thanks
01:46:07	Amy:	thank you
01:46:48	Harrison:	thanks!
01:46:59	Emily Jing:	thank you. have a good evening!
01:47:05	dbl:	thanks 
01:47:09	LL:	thanks
