00:06:20	EJing:	yes, sure. I prefer to be muted
00:06:21	EJing:	thanks
00:06:57	EJing:	some 2B past papers are so hard
00:19:36	Cameron:	could you explain what adjusted premiums mean in step 5?
00:20:33	BS:	when actual lapse increase/decrease, premium could change?
00:20:34	kat:	indexation etc ?
00:22:17	jay:	would the actual claims also affect the actual premiums received?
00:24:09	Cameron:	yeah, I would have thought it would be adjusted after claims then actual after lapses
00:24:26	Cameron:	thanks
00:29:52	EJing:	yes,good
00:32:31	jay:	nope
00:43:17	Cameron:	is it interest in excess of BEL or excess of PL?
00:46:39	jay:	if the policy liability is positive, does it mean it's unprofitable?
00:47:16	cat:	not necessarily, it could also because of over-conservative best estimate assumptions
00:47:16	EJing:	I think so if PL at t=0 is positive
00:57:54	Cameron:	in the spreadsheet you were on it talked about interest on assets in excess of BEL. Should that be the BEL or should it say policy liability instead?
00:58:38	Cameron:	oh okay 
00:59:13	Cameron:	so in general it should be PL?
00:59:47	Cameron:	thaniks 
01:05:45	Recoba:	Think it is Apr2011 Q1. Q2 is related to Appraisal values
01:06:03	EJing:	Hi Georgina, for 2B past papers, how many years should we go back? 
01:07:20	EJing:	thanks
01:07:33	BS:	thanks
