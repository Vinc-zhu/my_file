00:17:42	George:	sydney
00:17:46	Jason Jiao:	I'm in Melb
00:18:14	Jason Jiao:	yeah
00:20:50	Bear:	Risk management text questions if that's okay
00:21:30	EJing:	could we get some capital questions for this course as past questions are Aus based
00:21:47	student:	capital chapter. While I see that we are going to cover it in one of the tuts, I feel that that chapter went over my head 
00:22:05	student:	especially given that old 2B papers are too australian specific
00:22:36	EJing:	Are you all right?
00:23:09	EJing:	normal code get concerns now :)
00:23:14	EJing:	cold
00:30:16	EJing:	so should we put the web camera beside, then both I and screen can be seen?
00:31:59	EJing:	build in one?
00:32:04	EJing:	I only use one, extended one
00:32:29	George:	yes
00:32:38	EJing:	I will reread, thanks
00:37:04	student:	I have a question about the policy reserves versus claims reserves. Question 1 - Are these reserves (policy and claims) being calculated and tracked in the same valuation system? 2nd question - IP product: Insurer will calculate the policy reserves (using incidence and annuity method) but also the insurer will be calculating the IBNR, RBNA and DLR?  Is it correct?
00:37:35	student:	my own question )
00:38:36	Cheng:	so total liability is sum of both?
00:39:39	student:	The question is - the liability is when we refer to the policy reserves, right? 
00:39:52	student:	but Claims reserves are not called liabilities, right?
00:40:18	EJing:	claim reserve, do you mean DLR?
00:41:08	student:	I can't imagine, how the tracking of the reserves is happening in real life
00:41:16	daniel:	sounds more like a Process question
00:41:24	daniel:	in Mod 10
00:41:58	student:	Pol liab = BEL + PVPM, where DLR is included?
00:42:41	EJing:	DLR should be part of BEL
00:42:58	Cheng:	yea DLR and IBNR they are all part of BEL, right?
00:42:59	student:	so, where DLR is included in calculation of POL LIab?
00:43:09	EJing:	and there are argument should profit margin included in DLR
00:43:15	student:	yep
00:43:23	EJing:	it is normally calculated separately in practice
00:46:02	student:	expected claim, interest
00:46:24	student:	number of lives in force - though it depends on assumptions
00:48:32	Bear:	you mentioned "we will not be retesting modelling / spreadsheet skills in the exam"?
00:52:05	Cheng:	how much information is enough to describe a model ….? it really depends on the level of experience of the audience
00:54:12	LL:	it happens at the end of year?
00:54:32	EJing:	lapse incur after death
00:55:40	student:	so you are saying that both rates are independent?
00:56:05	student:	right, I misheard
00:56:08	EJing:	no, they are not
00:56:09	student:	thanks
00:56:21	M Stulman:	They are not since the higher the mortality the h=lower the lapse
00:57:00	student:	so, if rates are independent, how the calculation of decreements will change?
00:57:23	student:	yep
00:57:37	EJing:	only apply to lx
00:57:42	EJing:	not lx-dx
01:01:01	George:	why is (al)x+1 applied to expenses and claims and (ap)x is applied to premiums? other spreadsheets are different..
01:02:10	George:	8th column
01:02:36	LL:	i think because premium is using the previous year’s premium times (ap)x?
01:02:43	daniel:	it works out to be the same
01:02:54	EJing:	yes
01:02:56	daniel:	(al)1 is 1
01:03:05	daniel:	times by (ap)x gets (al)2
01:04:42	student:	yep
01:04:44	student:	it is correct
01:05:03	George:	I don't see how
01:05:09	George:	they are different values
01:05:20	George:	(ap)x is always above 0.8
01:05:25	daniel:	(ap)x is applied each year to the previous premium
01:06:01	daniel:	the previous premium implicitly has (al)x already
01:06:14	George:	okay, I see what you mean
01:06:19	EJing:	Annual_premium*VLOOKUP(P5,Decrement,4,FALSE)give the same answer
01:06:28	George:	thanks
01:06:42	daniel:	(y) 
01:09:33	EJing:	total profit is same
01:09:37	student:	the total profit stays the same
01:09:45	EJing:	just change the pattern of release
01:09:47	student:	but the timing changes
01:11:32	EJing:	non profitable product
01:11:34	student:	product is priced at zero profit margin
01:12:48	student:	the profit is released faster at CB2
01:13:51	student:	there are tax implications, right?
01:14:14	student:	is there any other implications to the faster release of profit?
01:15:33	Bear:	Does it mean profit margin is there partially for the cost of capital? and any margin above IRR goes to retained earning
01:15:42	student:	okeeeyyy… if experience is as assumed, the profit (transfers) will flow to the P&L, right?
01:17:07	student:	oh yea.. discount and the interest rates are interesting...
01:17:20	student:	especially for stepped vs level premium product
01:18:50	RD:	is the interest accrued still on a conservative basis?
01:20:27	RD:	how come in the following year we don't allow for the previous differences in expenses?
01:21:49	McGeorge, Helena:	why do we adjust for the interest on actual expenses in conservative basis 2, but we don't adjust for interest on actual claims in conservative basis 1? we seem to assume that the 10% higher claims is realised
01:21:55	RD:	yep
01:22:34	Stephanie Martin:	is it because we assume claims occur at end of year, so we don't earn on interest on the claims?
01:22:54	LL:	is it because the interest on the previous year expense difference has been recognised as profit for that year?
01:25:13	daniel:	a couple spreadsheets mention their basis has an odd quirk
01:25:27	daniel:	does anyone know what it is?
01:25:59	daniel:	okk
01:26:32	student:	I found these spreadsheet not very usable - meaning that splitting CF, liability and final tables into separate tabs is pretty confusing
01:27:02	student:	I ended up rebuilding them from scratch and putting everything in the same tab
01:27:21	student:	so, I have - assumptions, data, calculations tabs 
01:28:12	student:	haha, lirpd session was pretty good yesterday
01:28:24	Cheng:	thanks
01:28:30	Donna:	thank you!
01:28:31	George:	Thank you, goodnight
01:28:36	EJing:	thank you all. good night!
01:28:42	LL:	thank you
01:28:51	daniel:	thanks
01:28:51	JC:	Thanks
01:28:53	Bear:	take care!
